# ArewaDS Fellowship Repository

## About This Repository
This repository is part of the ArewaDS Fellowship program, an initiative aimed at empowering participants with in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in Python programming, data science, and machine learning. Throughout the fellowship, we will explore foundational and advanced topics, applying them to real-world scenarios and datasets to tackle complex problems.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a central hub for all coursework, projects, and resources related to the fellowship. By working through various projects and exercises, we aim to develop the skills needed to analyze data, build predictive models, and derive insights that can contribute to solving some of the world's most pressing issuesâ€”ranging from healthcare and education to environmental challenges.

This repository will document our progress and showcase our learning journey and achievements as we advance in the fields of data science and machine learning.
